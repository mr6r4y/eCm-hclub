# Hacking Club Ch01 - 23th June 2017

## Very short Python Intro

In order to have very basic understanding of simple python scripts,
I'm going to describe a few things about Python lang using [crackme0x03_decode.py](excercises/crackme0x03_decode.py).

### crackme0x03_decode.py

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
## This is called 'shebang' and it is the standard way in Unix to say:
##   "This is script. Use program X to run it!"


## In Python modularity is achieved through 'modules' and 'packages'.
## A 'module' is a .py file that is directly imported. A 'package' is
## a bundle of modules in a directory that also contains '__init__.py' file.

import argparse     # Module that handles command line arguments

import sys          # Module that has a few basic system functions.
                    # We use it here to gather "standard input" of our program


def get_args():     # Function definition here
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=("crackme0x03 string decoder"))

    ## Use of argparse module to enable "help" of our program by:
    ##    $> ./our_program.py --help

    args = parser.parse_args()

    return args


def main():
    args = get_args()

    s = sys.stdin.read()
    if s is not None:
        ## This is little tricky:
        ##     - print is statement in Python 2 and a function in Python 3
        ##     - '' is empty string of type "str"
        ##     - '' as anything in Python is object and objects have methods
        ##     - ''.join() method takes 1 arg of type "list". ".join()" uses ''
        ##       as glue and glues the list elements together with it
        ##     - in Python we have "list comprehensions": [i for i in my_iterable]
        ##     - ord() returns an ASCII integer from string character
        ##     - chr() does the opposite
        print ''.join([chr(ord(i) - 3) for i in s.strip()])



## This is a popular Python idiom.
## This is a check if the current file is directly used as
## script or it is imported. If directly called __main__ is the
## __name__.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

## Excercises

### Crackme0x03

You can check [crackme0x03.r2](excercises/crackme0x03.r2), [crackme0x03_analysis.r2](excercises/[crackme0x03_analysis.r2),
[crackme0x03_decode.py](excercises/crackme0x03_decode.py).

## What is Next?

We continue with [crackme0x04](excercises/crackme0x04). It is yet another calculation
algorithm. This time a little more complex.
