## Basic Radare2 navigation

### Lets start

We open an executable in Radare2 with the following command:
```bash
r2 ./executable
```

If we need to make fixes or patches, we need 'write' permissions:
```bash
r2 -w ./executable
```
and the `-w` option is used.

For opening a session in the standard debugger (which is GDB in Linux):
```bash
r2 -d ./executable
```

For starting Radare2 and executing a script right after our file is loaded:
```bash
r2 -i ./radare_script.r2 ./executable
```

### Navigation

You are dropped at the `entry0` flag, which is the program entrypoint
described by a field in the executable format:

```
[0x08048310]>
```

The address between `[` and `]` is our current location in the file or memory.
In Radare2 this is our main navigation using the command line interface. Most of
the commands we execute implicitly take our current location.

When we are dealing with executable files (ELF, PE, MachO, etc), Radare2 is
kind enough to represent the space and addresses we can reach as if the file is
loaded in memory for execution. That is why we can see the file itself starting
from offset `[0x00000000]>`, but also we see the same file mapped to `[0x08048000]>`
(this is the standard memory address at which ELF32 is loaded into its process memory).

We can change our current location with `s` command. The parameter can be an address
or a `flag`:

```
[0x08048310]> s 0x08048000
[0x08048000]> s main
[0x08048470]>
```

### Help

Whenever in doubt about how to use a command - type `?` or command's first character and `?`:

```
[0x08048470]> ?
Usage: [.][times][cmd][~grep][@[@iter]addr!size][|>pipe] ; ...
Append '?' to any char command to get detailed help
Prefix with number to repeat command N times (f.ex: 3x)
|%var =valueAlias for 'env' command
| *[?] off[=[0x]value]    Pointer read/write data/values (see ?v, wx, wv)
| (macro arg0 arg1)       Manage scripting macros

...

| ?@?                     Misc help for '@' (seek), '~' (grep) (see ~??)
| ?:?                     List and manage core plugins
[0x08048470]> s?
|Usage: s  # Seek commands
| s                 Print current address
| s:pad             Print current address with N padded zeros (defaults to 8)

...

| sr pc             Seek to register
| ss                Seek silently (without adding an entry to the seek history)

### Analysis

`a` is the "analysis" command. Usually `aaa` is used for full analysis:

```
[0x08048310]> aaa
[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)
[x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)
[x] Analyze function calls (aac)
[ ] [*] Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.
[x] Constructing a function name for fcn.* and sym.func.* functions (aan))
[0x08048310]>
```

### Printing

`p` is used to print stuff around. By using `x` form you can print hexadecimal
representation of regions:

```
[0x08048470]> px @ 0x0
- offset -   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF

```

Or we can print disassembly of code we want to analyse by `pd?` form:

```
[0x08048310]> s main
[0x08048470]> pdf
            ;-- main:

|           0x0804849a      8b4dfc         mov ecx, dword [local_4h_2]
|           0x0804849d      c9             leave

```

The `@` (at) is used to point to different location then the current one.
`d` in the command stands for "disassemble" and `f` for "function".
`pdf` works after analysis phase, otherwise there is no function found.
Using only `pd` (using number-of-instructions as argument) or `pD` 
(using number-of-bytes as argument) disassembles data where you point it.

## Calling functions

Lets see what is going under the hood when a function is called in a C program.
The sample we use is [func_call.c](samples/func_call.c). In order to track easily
the program flow, numbers 1 to 3 are assigned to local variables and 4 to 6 are
passed as arguments to `my_func()`.

For illustration how scripting is used I have prepared a
script to use for analysis of this program.

Compile the samples using:

```bash
cd eCm-hclub/ch01/samples
make
```

Then you can execute [func_call_static.r2](samples/func_call_static.r2):

```bash
r2 -i ./func_call_static.r2 ./func_call_x86
```

### First impressions

Lets take a look at the assembly:

![Function call](img/func_call_asm.png)

There are several interesting things to notice:

* arguments to functions are pushed on the stack in opposite order
* stack is cleaned from arguments after each function `call`
* a function has a *prologue* and an *epilogue*
* function's local variables are on the stack and space is reserved for them

The `leave` instruction does just the opposite of the *prologue*.
`leave` is equivalent to:

```nasm
mov esp, ebp
pop ebp
```

which is called a function *epilogue*.

The names of `local_?h` and `arg_?h` in instructions:

```nasm
; ...
mov dword [local_14h], 1
mov dword [local_10h], 2
mov dword [local_ch], 3
; ...
mov eax, dword [arg_8h]     ; [0x8:4]=0
add edx, eax
mov eax, dword [arg_ch]     ; [0xc:4]=0
add edx, eax
mov eax, dword [arg_10h]    ; [0x10:4]=0x30002
; ...
```

are placed by our analysis tools. You can see what their meaning is from
the comment also placed by analysis:

```nasm
; var int local_14h @ ebp-0x14
; var int local_10h @ ebp-0x10
; var int local_ch @ ebp-0xc
; arg int arg_8h @ ebp+0x8
; arg int arg_ch @ ebp+0xc
; arg int arg_10h @ ebp+0x10
```
So what we see is after the function *prologue* we have a starting point
saved in the frame register (`ebp`). Forward we have our local variables
(stack grows backwards so *forward* is `ebp-0x??`) and backwards we see 
the function's arguments (`ebp+0x??`). That is the main mechanism used
by most compilers to deal with functions/procedures in higher languages.

What is very important to have in our minds is the pattern of memory on the 
stack at that moment.
