## Excercises

### Crackme0x02

You can check [crackme0x00.r2](excercises/crackme0x02.r2) and [crackme0x02_analysis.r2](excercises/crackme0x02_analysis.r2).

## What is Next?

Next time we are going to analyse [crackme0x03](excercises/crackme0x03), but this time 
the `Password:` is of no interest - it is the same as in [crackme0x02](excercises/crackme0x02).
What is interesting in [crackme0x03](excercises/crackme0x03) is the encoded strings.
This is a common practice for anti-reversing. The author encodes all the strings in the
program and decodes them on the fly. That way you must analyse thoroughly the code and
cannot rely on found strings through out the program to make assumptions - strings are obfuscated.

For homework try to analyse `sym.shift` function and write a simple script for decoding.
I leave a simple ([crackme0x03.r2](excercises/crackme0x03.r2)) helper script to point you the direction.
