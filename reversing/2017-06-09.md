## Samples

### Pointer to local variable

Lets examine [local_pointer.c](samples/local_pointer.c). We are interested what
trick is used to get a pointer to local variable in a function:

```c
int x;   /* `x` is a local variable for `main()` */

...

scanf ("%d", &x);   /* How `&x` is represented? */
```

Compile the samples by:

```bash
cd eCm-hclub/ch01/samples
make
```

and we are openning `local_pointer_x86`:

```bash
r2 ./local_pointer_x86
```

The [local_pointer_x86.r2](samples/local_pointer_x86.r2) is autoloaded and we can see
the dissassembly of the interesting part:

```nasm
; Mind that variables and arguments on the stack
; are analysed by Radare2 and are presented in
; readable form - `local_1ch` is actually `esp+0x1c`

lea eax, [local_1ch]                            ; var int local_1ch @ esp+0x1c
; `eax` has the address of `local_1ch`

mov dword [local_4h], eax                       ; var int local_4h @ esp+0x4 and 2nd argument on the stack
; Now the memory at `local_4h` has the pointer
; to `local_1ch` a.k.a. `&x`

; The rest should be familiar :)
mov dword [esp], 0x8048589                      ; 1st argument to `scanf()` - "%d"
call sym.imp.__isoc99_scanf                     ; imported `scanf()` from standard libc
```

Although confusing at first (seeing the use of `lea` instruction), the trick is to remember
the pattern.

You can check [scanf()](https://linux.die.net/man/3/scanf) for details on how to use it.

## Hints

### Radare2 implicit script load

If you name a `.r2` script same as program under analysis it is auto-loaded:

```bash
...$ cd eCm-hclub/ch01/excercises

...$ ls -al | grep crackme0x00

-rwxrwxr-x 1 pvalov pvalov 7537 May 22 09:05 crackme0x00
-rw-rw-r-- 1 pvalov pvalov  266 Jun 12 09:58 crackme0x00.r2

...$ r2 crackme0x00
NOTE: Loading 'crackme0x00.r2' script.

...

[0x08048360]>
```

## Excercises

### Crackme0x00

You can check [crackme0x00.r2](excercises/crackme0x00.r2)

### Crackme0x01

You can check [crackme0x01.r2](excercises/crackme0x01.r2)
